# CC_02

CC_02 is a little project I created during my practicum at Concordia Versicherungen. This Company is a private insurance provider with a big it section. So for my own project I choose to make a SQlite Database for storing insurance contracts. This database is accessible by a web-interface written in Rust called Rocket. Also the handling of the contracts is written in Rust.

You can view the projects plans in Notes.md
